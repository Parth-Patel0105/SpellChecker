Test 1: Basic Spellchecking (test1.txt)
Description: This test verifies basic spellchecking capabilities, including handling of capital letters and punctuation.
Expected Behavior: spchk should correctly identify all words as spelled correctly, given a comprehensive dictionary. The test includes variations in capitalization to ensure case-insensitivity except for proper handling of initial capitals.

Test 2: Proper Nouns and Capitalization (test2.txt)
Description: Tests proper noun recognition and sensitivity to initial capitalization.
Expected Behavior: Proper nouns like "MacDonald" should be recognized in their exact form or in all uppercase. However, "macdonald" should not be considered correct unless explicitly included in the dictionary.

Test 3: Punctuation Handling (test3.txt)
Description: Focuses on spchk's ability to handle punctuation correctly, including quotes, parentheses, and commas.
Expected Behavior: spchk should ignore punctuation at the beginning and end of words, allowing for correct identification of words. Commas without a following space should result in an error.

Test 4: Case Sensitivity (test4.txt)

Test 8: Special Characters (test8.txt)
Description: This test checks how spchk deals with words that contain special characters not present in the basic ASCII character set.
